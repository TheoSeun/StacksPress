##  Public Functions

###  Content Interaction

#### `contribute-item`
Submit new content.
```clojure
(contribute-item (headline) (hyperlink) (topic))
```
- Validates topic, hyperlink length, and charges `submission-charge`.
- Transfers fee to `PROTOCOL_ADMINISTRATOR`.
- Assigns unique `item-identifier`.

#### `appraise-item`
Vote (up/down) on content.
```clojure
(appraise-item (item-identifier) (appraisal))
```
- `appraisal` must be `1` (upvote) or `-1` (downvote).
- Tracks user vote and adjusts both the itemâ€™s score and user credibility.

#### `reward-originator`
Tip the content creator.
```clojure
(reward-originator (item-identifier) (gratuity-amount))
```
- Transfers STX to the original contributor.
- Updates total gratuity for the content.

#### `flag-item`
Flag content as inappropriate.
```clojure
(flag-item (item-identifier))
```
- Increments flag count unless the user is the content originator.
